                No - CRYPTO20 is not a platform. It is an autonomous,
                high-performance, low-cost cryptocurrency index fund.
                Development of the trading system is complete - CRYPTO20 offers
                value now, not at some point in the future. Diversification to
                the top 20 cryptocurrencies is now possible by holding a single
                token.

                CRYPTO20 has been established in the Cayman Islands
                jurisdiction. The Caymans are a popular international
                jurisdiction for the incorporation of investment funds. The
                Cayman jurisdiction has seen a strong increase in private equity
                funds year on year over the past decade. The popularity of
                Cayman private equity funds has been fuelled by the increase in
                hedge fund managers growing into the private equity space and by
                the increased use of private equity funds to pursue distressed
                asset investments. The Cayman limited liability company (LLC)
                was introduced last year as a flexible, tax-neutral low-cost
                fund vehicle with a corporate personality. The LLC is a flexible
                structure ideally suited for use as a closed-end investment
                vehicle. The Cayman LLC was established under legislation that
                was drafted with the key terms of private equity vehicles in
                mind. The registration, due diligence and reporting requirements
                which arise from this legislation is generally delegated to a
                private equity fundâ€™s administrator. The procedures are closely
                aligned with existing anti-money laundering (AML/KYC)
                requirements to ensure that the use of Cayman vehicles for
                private equity structures remains a low cost option. Please see
                this Deloitte report for more.
